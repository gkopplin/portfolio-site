											<h2>Grumblr</h2>
											<a href="https://grumblr-app.herokuapp.com">Live</a> | <a href="https://github.com/gkopplin/grumblr">Github</a>
											<p>
												A full-stack Tumblr clone for grumpy people built using PostgreSQL, Rails, and React/Redux. Cloud store is implemented to improve the scaling of the application using the AWS S3 API. Supports posts
												of many media types including text, photo, video, audio, and links.
											</p>
											<h1>Features:</h1>
											<ul>
												<li><h3>1. Splash Page</h3>
													<p>
														The welcome page of Grumblr features a sliding carousel of pages, which rotates as the user scrolls or clicks the scroll
														icons. DOM event listeners change the classes of HTML elements when the user scrolls or clicks an icon. The updated
														classes contain keyframes animations which cause certain elements to slide or fade depending on the current position of
														the carousel and the direction of the scroll. <br>
														For instance, if the user were viewing the second splash page and scrolled back up to the first, the direction key in
														the splash React component state would be changed to "up2-1" and the props of the individual splash pages would be
														updated accordingly. Within each splash page, the root HTML element is set to props.direction. The CSS class for up2-1
														contains a keyframes animation with a translateY transformation from -100% to 0%.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li><h3>2. Search</h3>
													<p>
														In the header of each page (except the splash page), there is a search bar which users can use to find users. When the
														user types into the search bar and adds characters to the search form element, a modal component is opened which
														contains search results. For each character added to the form, relevant users are fetched from the backend and the
														search results are re-rendered. Users can then click users to redirect to their profile page, or press enter to redirect
														to the first user listed in the search results.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li><h3>3. Follows</h3>
													<p>
														The follows joins table links followers with the users they follow. In order to limit the current user's dashboard to
														posts from users they follow, AJAX requests are sent to the backend and the follows joins table is queried. Similarly,
														the association between users and their followers is used to populate the followers and following pages with the correct
														users.
													</p>
												</li>

											<h2>Maze Escape</h2>
											<a href="https://gkopplin.github.io/maze-escape/">Live</a> | <a href="https://github.com/gkopplin/maze-escape">Github</a>
											<p>
												A retro, turn-based JavaScript game where users must escape mazes without being caught by AI enemies. Built
												using HTML5 Canvas.
											</p>
											<h1>Features:</h1>
											<ul>
												<li><h3>1. Level Progression</h3>
													<p>
														When a user reaches the exit of a level, the Game object will hide the HTML Canvas element and show the root div element
														(by modifying the classes of each). The appropriate image is also pushed into the inner HTML of the root element. A DOM
														keypress event listener is added to re-show the HTML Canvas element when the user is ready to progress to the next
														level. A similar system is set up for when the users loses a level or wins the game.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li><h3>2. Collision Detection</h3>
													<p>
														If/else logic is used to determine whether a given move is valid based on the characters position and surrounding
														obstacles. For any given move, collisions are detected using the x position of the character and the y position plus the
														height of the character sprite (since characters are able to stand in front of walls, but cannot walk through them).
														Since the game is implemented on a 50x50 grid system, characters will always be a given distance from adjacent walls.
														Each time a character moves, the array of walls is iterated over to confirm that no wall blocks the characters path. In
														addition to the original position of the character, the function for determining valid moves also takes a new position
														that the character is attempting to travel to. The values of the new position and the orientation of the wall and used
														to determine if the character is attempting to walk through a wall.
